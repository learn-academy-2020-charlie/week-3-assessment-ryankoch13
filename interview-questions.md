# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is a tool in JavaScript that lets you quickly and cleanly assign the properties of an object to variables you can work with in a function or block of code. 

  Researched answer: Destructuring can also be used with arrays and you can assign your own variable names to each value using a colon. 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is any interaction between the user and the interface. 

  Researched answer: They are events or interactions with the webpage that are detected by the DOM and used to trigger JavaScript. 



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is like a blueprint for making an object. They have predetermined properties and values that will be assigned to a new object that is created whenever that class' constructor is called. 

  Researched answer: An object is explicitly defined when initialized



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: I actually don't know. 

  Researched answer: A div is a general element used to structure HTML documents, while a span is an inline tag used to style a specific piece of text within an existing div or other element. 



5. What is React.Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: A react fragment is a an HTML container used in JSX for React that does not create nodes on the DOM when rendered. This allows you to wrap your entire HTML to be rendered in a lightweight, outer-most tag that React can enterpret. 

  Researched answer: React fragments can also be used to group components in the render to make your code cleaner. If you use the full declaration React.Fragment you may need to pass it a key. 



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: Using the :hover method in CSS, using JavaScript to animate your sidebar (@keyframes), or by using mediaqueries to ensure the content matches the size of the viewing pane. 

  Researched answer: It's actually called a viewport and you can also use viewport units to make text and element sizing responsive to the size of the screen. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming - Ojected oriented programming is a programming paradigm in which programmers must define the data type as well as the functions that can be applied to said data structures. 

- irb - Interactive Ruby - an easy way to practice writing Ruby code without having to create a file (all in the comfort of your very own Mac terminal!)
- Instance variable - A variable defined in the class, so that each object constructed from that class has its own instance

- Ruby - A high-level, object oriented programming language designed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto. It has a unique culture and design concept centered around programmer happiness and ease of use. MINASWAN

- Class relationships - Ways of sharing, accessing, or changing data and properties in classes or objects

- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby - It is considered bad practice to expose an object's actual value to the world. We can use Getter and Setter methods to access or change an object's properties and values without directly interacting with that object.
